abstract: 'Importance: Given that hypertension remains a leading risk factor for chronic
  disease globally, there are substantial ongoing efforts to define the optimal range
  of blood pressure (BP). Objective: To identify a common threshold level above which
  BP rise tends to accelerate in progression toward hypertension. Design, Setting,
  and Participants: This longitudinal, community-based epidemiological cohort study
  of adults enrolled in Framingham, Massachusetts, included 1252 participants (mean
  [SD] age, 35.3 [2.7] years) from the Framingham Original Cohort, of whom 790 (63.1%)
  were women. Each participant contributed up to 28 serial examinations of standardized
  resting BP measurements between 1948 and 2005. Exposures: Age and systolic BP. Main
  Outcomes and Measures: Via a segmented mixed model, we identified significant change
  points in the association between advancing age and increasing systolic BP among
  individuals categorized by their age at hypertension onset. Results: Individuals
  maintained a relatively stable resting systolic BP level prior to hypertension onset.
  Systolic BP level began to rise at a more rapid rate after reaching a level of 123.2
  mm Hg (95% CI, 122.7-130.1 mm Hg) in people with onset at 40 to 49 years; 122.0
  mm Hg (95% CI, 120.3-123.9 mm Hg) in those with onset between 50 and 59 years, 124.9
  mm Hg (95% CI, 120.2-127.9 mm Hg) in those with onset between 60 and 69 years, and
  120.5 mm Hg (95% CI, 118.0-123.2 mm Hg) in those with onset between 70 and 79 years
  (P = .29 for between-group heterogeneity). Conclusions and Relevance: We observed
  that individuals in the community generally maintained a systolic BP of less than
  120 to 125 mm Hg, above which systolic BP increased at a relatively rapid rate toward
  overt hypertension. This trend was consistent whether the hypertension manifested
  earlier or later in life. Thus, a resting systolic BP that chronically exceeds the
  range of approximately 120 to 125 mm Hg may represent an important threshold of
  underlying vascular remodeling and signal incipient hypertension irrespective of
  age. Further investigations are needed to unravel the sequence of hemodynamic and
  vascular changes occurring prior to hypertension onset.'
