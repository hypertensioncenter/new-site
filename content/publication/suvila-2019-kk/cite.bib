 abstract = {Early onset hypertension confers increased risk for
cardiovascular mortality in the community. Whether early onset
hypertension also promotes the development of target end-organ
damage (TOD), even by midlife, has remained unknown. We studied
2680 middle-aged CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development
in Young Adults) Study participants (mean age 50$±$4 years,
57% women) who underwent up to 8 serial blood pressure
measurements between 1985 and 2011 (age range at baseline 18-30
years) in addition to assessments of echocardiographic left
ventricular hypertrophy, coronary calcification, albuminuria,
and diastolic dysfunction in 2010 to 2011. Age of hypertension
onset was defined as the age at first of 2 consecutively
attended examinations with blood pressure $≥$140/90 mm Hg or
use of antihypertensive medication. Participants were divided in
groups by hypertension onset age (<35 years, 35-44 years,
$≥$45 years, or no hypertension). While adjusting for TOD
risk factors, including systolic blood pressure, we used
logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for cases
(participants with TOD) versus controls (participants without
TOD) to examine the relation of hypertension onset age and
hypertensive TOD. Compared with normotensive individuals,
hypertension onset at age <35 years was related to odds ratios
of 2.29 (95% CI, 1.36-3.86), 2.94 (95% CI, 1.57-5.49), 1.12
(95% CI, 0.55-2.29), and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.04-4.05) for left
ventricular hypertrophy, coronary calcification, albuminuria,
and diastolic dysfunction, respectively. In contrast,
hypertension onset at age $≥$45 years was not related to
increased odds of TOD. Our findings emphasize the importance of
assessing age of hypertension onset in hypertensive patients to
identify high-risk individuals for preventing hypertensive
complications.},
