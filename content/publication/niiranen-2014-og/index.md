abstract: Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) is considered as the gold standard of BP
  measurement although it has not been shown to be more strongly associated with cardiovascular
  risk than is home BP. Our objective was to compare the prognostic value of office,
  home, and ambulatory BP for cardiovascular risk in 502 participants examined in
  1992 to 1996. The end point was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial
  infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and coronary intervention. We
  assessed the prognostic value of each BP in multivariable-adjusted Cox models. The
  likelihood $χ$2 ratio value was used to test whether the addition of a BP variable
  improved the model's goodness of fit. After a follow-up of 16.1$±$3.9 years, 70
  participants (13.9%) had experienced $≥$1 cardiovascular event. Office (systolic/diastolic
  hazard ratio per 1/1 mm Hg increase in BP, 1.024/1.018; systolic/diastolic 95% confidence
  interval, 1.009--1.040/0.994--1.043), home (hazard ratio, 1.029/1.028; 95% confidence
  interval, 1.013--1.045/1.005--1.052), and 24-hour ambulatory BP (hazard ratio, 1.033/1.049;
  95% confidence interval, 1.019--1.047/1.023--1.077) were predictive of cardiovascular
  events. When all 3 BP variables were included in the model simultaneously, only
  systolic/diastolic ambulatory BP was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events
  (P=0.002/<0.001). Home systolic/diastolic BP improved the fit of the model only
  marginally when added to a model including office BP ($χ$2=3.0/4.0, P=0.09/0.047).
  Ambulatory BP, however, improved the fit of model more clearly when added to office
  and home BP ($χ$2=9.0/12.3, P=0.001/<0.001). Our findings suggest that ambulatory
  BP is prognostically superior to office and home BP.
