 abstract = {AIMS: Parental hypertension is known to predict high blood
pressure (BP) in children. However, the extent to which risk for
hypertension is conferred across multiple generations,
notwithstanding the impact of environmental factors, is unclear.
Our objective was therefore to evaluate the degree to which risk
for hypertension extends across multiple generations of
individuals in the community. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied
three generations of Framingham Heart Study participants with
standardized blood pressure measurements performed at serial
examinations spanning 5 decades (1948 through 2005): First
Generation (n = 1809), Second Generation (n = 2631), and Third
Generation (n = 3608, mean age 39 years, 53% women). To capture
a more precise estimate of conferrable risk, we defined
early-onset hypertension (age <55 years) as the primary exposure.
In multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for standard
risk factors as well as physical activity and daily intake of
dietary sodium, risk for hypertension in the Third Generation was
conferred simultaneously by presence of early-onset hypertension
in parents [OR 2.10 (95% CI, 1.66-2.67), P < 0.001] as well as
in grandparents [OR 1.33 (95% CI, 1.12-1.58), P < 0.01].
CONCLUSION: Early-onset hypertension in grandparents raises the
risk for hypertension in grandchildren, even after adjusting for
early-onset hypertension in parents and lifestyle factors. These
results suggest that a substantial familial predisposition for
hypertension exists, and this predisposition is not identical
when assessed from one generation to the next. Additional studies
are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
transgenerational risk for hypertension and its clinical
implications.},
