abstract: "Objective To determine the role of early onset versus late onset hypertension
  as a risk factor for hypertension in offspring and cardiovascular death.Design Multigenerational,
  prospective cohort study.Setting Framingham Heart Study.Participants Two generations
  of community dwelling participants with blood pressure measurements performed at
  serial examinations spanning six decades: 3614 first generation participants with
  mortality data and 1635 initially non-hypertensive second generation participants
  with data available on parental blood pressure.Main outcome measures The main outcome
  measures were relation of parental early onset hypertension (age <55 years) with
  incidence of hypertension in offspring, using regression analyses, and relation
  of age at hypertension onset with cause specific mortality using a case (cardiovascular
  death) versus control (non-cardiovascular death) design.Results In second generation
  participants, having one or both parents with late onset hypertension did not increase
  the risk of hypertension compared with having parents with no hypertension; by contrast,
  the hazard ratios of hypertension were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.5)
  and 3.5 (1.9 to 6.1) in participants with one and both parents with early onset
  hypertension, respectively. In first generation decedents, 1151 cardiovascular deaths
  occurred (including 630 coronary deaths). The odds of cardiovascular death increased
  linearly with decreasing age of hypertension onset (P<0.001 for trend). Compared
  with non-hypertensive participants, hypertension onset at age <45 years conferred
  an odds ratios of 2.2 (1.8 to 2.7) for cardiovascular death and 2.3 (1.8 to 2.9)
  for coronary death, whereas hypertension onset at age $≥$65 years conferred a lower
  magnitude odds ratios of 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9) for cardiovascular death and 1.4 (0.98
  to 1.9) for coronary death (P$łeq$0.002 for differences in odds ratios between hypertension
  onset at age <45 and age $≥$65).Conclusions Early onset and not late onset hypertension
  in parents was strongly associated with hypertension in offspring. In turn, early
  onset compared with late onset hypertension was associated with greater odds of
  cardiovascular, and particularly coronary, death. These findings suggest it may
  be important to distinguish between early onset and late onset hypertension as a
  familial trait when assessing an individual's risk for hypertension, and as a specific
  type of blood pressure trait when estimating risk for cardiovascular outcomes in
  adults with established hypertension."
