abstract: Fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the world. Its connection
  with the gut microbiome has been known for at least 80 y, but this association remains
  mostly unstudied in the general population because of underdiagnosis and small sample
  sizes. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the link between the Fatty Liver
  Index (FLI), a well-established proxy for fatty liver disease, and gut microbiome
  composition in a representative, ethnically homogeneous population sample of 6,269
  Finnish participants. We based our models on biometric covariates and gut microbiome
  compositions from shallow metagenome sequencing. Our classification models could
  discriminate between individuals with a high FLI ($≥$60, indicates likely liver
  steatosis) and low FLI (<60) in internal cross-region validation, consisting of
  30% of the data not used in model training, with an average AUC of 0.75 and AUPRC
  of 0.56 (baseline at 0.30). In addition to age and sex, our models included differences
  in 11 microbial groups from class Clostridia, mostly belonging to orders Lachnospirales
  and Oscillospirales. Our models were also predictive of the high FLI group in a
  different Finnish cohort, consisting of 258 participants, with an average AUC of
  0.77 and AUPRC of 0.51 (baseline at 0.21). Pathway analysis of representative genomes
  of the positively FLI-associated taxa in (NCBI) Clostridium subclusters IV and XIVa
  indicated the presence of, e.g., ethanol fermentation pathways. These results support
  several findings from smaller case-control studies, such as the role of endogenous
  ethanol producers in the development of the fatty liver.
