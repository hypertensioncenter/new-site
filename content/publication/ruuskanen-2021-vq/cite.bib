 abstract = {Fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the
world. Its connection with the gut microbiome has been known for
at least 80 y, but this association remains mostly unstudied in
the general population because of underdiagnosis and small
sample sizes. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the link
between the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a well-established proxy
for fatty liver disease, and gut microbiome composition in a
representative, ethnically homogeneous population sample of
6,269 Finnish participants. We based our models on biometric
covariates and gut microbiome compositions from shallow
metagenome sequencing. Our classification models could
discriminate between individuals with a high FLI ($≥$60,
indicates likely liver steatosis) and low FLI (<60) in internal
cross-region validation, consisting of 30% of the data not used
in model training, with an average AUC of 0.75 and AUPRC of 0.56
(baseline at 0.30). In addition to age and sex, our models
included differences in 11 microbial groups from class
Clostridia, mostly belonging to orders Lachnospirales and
Oscillospirales. Our models were also predictive of the high FLI
group in a different Finnish cohort, consisting of 258
participants, with an average AUC of 0.77 and AUPRC of 0.51
(baseline at 0.21). Pathway analysis of representative genomes
of the positively FLI-associated taxa in (NCBI) Clostridium
subclusters IV and XIVa indicated the presence of, e.g., ethanol
fermentation pathways. These results support several findings
from smaller case-control studies, such as the role of
endogenous ethanol producers in the development of the fatty
liver.},
