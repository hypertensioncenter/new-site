 abstract = {The collection of fecal material and developments in sequencing
technologies have enabled standardised and non-invasive gut
microbiome profiling. Microbiome composition from several large
cohorts have been cross-sectionally linked to various lifestyle
factors and diseases. In spite of these advances, prospective
associations between microbiome composition and health have
remained uncharacterised due to the lack of sufficiently large
and representative population cohorts with comprehensive
follow-up data. Here, we analyse the long-term association
between gut microbiome variation and mortality in a
well-phenotyped and representative population cohort from
Finland (n = 7211). We report robust taxonomic and functional
microbiome signatures related to the Enterobacteriaceae family
that are associated with mortality risk during a 15-year
follow-up. Our results extend previous cross-sectional studies,
and help to establish the basis for examining long-term
associations between human gut microbiome composition, incident
outcomes, and general health status.},
