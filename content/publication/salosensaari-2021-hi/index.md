abstract: The collection of fecal material and developments in sequencing technologies
  have enabled standardised and non-invasive gut microbiome profiling. Microbiome
  composition from several large cohorts have been cross-sectionally linked to various
  lifestyle factors and diseases. In spite of these advances, prospective associations
  between microbiome composition and health have remained uncharacterised due to the
  lack of sufficiently large and representative population cohorts with comprehensive
  follow-up data. Here, we analyse the long-term association between gut microbiome
  variation and mortality in a well-phenotyped and representative population cohort
  from Finland (n = 7211). We report robust taxonomic and functional microbiome signatures
  related to the Enterobacteriaceae family that are associated with mortality risk
  during a 15-year follow-up. Our results extend previous cross-sectional studies,
  and help to establish the basis for examining long-term associations between human
  gut microbiome composition, incident outcomes, and general health status.
