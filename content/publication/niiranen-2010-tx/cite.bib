 abstract = {Previous studies with some limitations have provided equivocal
results for the prognostic significance of home-measured blood
pressure (BP). We investigated whether home-measured BP is more
strongly associated with cardiovascular events and total
mortality than is office BP. A prospective nationwide study was
initiated in 2000 to 2001 on 2081 randomly selected subjects
aged 45 to 74 years. Home and office BP were determined at
baseline along with other cardiovascular risk factors. The
primary end point was incidence of a cardiovascular event
(cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, percutaneous
coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery).
The secondary end point was total mortality. After a mean
follow-up of 6.8 years, 162 subjects had experienced a
cardiovascular event, and 118 subjects had died. In Cox
proportional hazard models adjusted for other cardiovascular
risk factors, office BP (systolic/diastolic hazard ratio [HR]
per 10/5 mm Hg increase in BP, 1.13/1.13; systolic/diastolic
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.22/1.05 to 1.22) and
home BP (HR, 1.23/1.18; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.34/1.10 to 1.27) were
predictive of cardiovascular events. However, when both BPs were
simultaneously included in the models, only home BP (HR,
1.22/1.15; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.37/1.05 to 1.26), not office BP
(HR, 1.01/1.06; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12/0.97 to 1.16), was
predictive of cardiovascular events. Systolic home BP was the
sole predictor of total mortality (HR, 1.11; 95% CI,
1.01/1.23). Our findings suggest that home-measured BP is
prognostically superior to office BP. On the basis of the
results of this and previous studies, it can be concluded that
home BP measurement offers specific advantages more than
conventional office measurement.},
