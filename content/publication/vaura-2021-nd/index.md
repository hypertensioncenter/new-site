abstract: Although genetic risk scores have been used to predict hypertension, their
  utility in the clinical setting remains uncertain. Our study comprised N=218 792
  FinnGen participants (mean age 58 years, 56% women) and N=22 624 well-phenotyped
  FINRISK participants (mean age 50 years, 53% women). We used public genome-wide
  association data to compute polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for systolic and diastolic
  blood pressure (BP). Using time-to-event analysis, we then assessed (1) the association
  of BP PRSs with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in FinnGen and (2)
  the improvement in model discrimination when combining BP PRSs with the validated
  4- and 10-year clinical risk scores for hypertension and CVD in FINRISK. In FinnGen,
  compared with having a 20 to 80 percentile range PRS, a PRS in the highest 2.5%
  conferred 2.3-fold (95% CI, 2.2--2.4) risk of hypertension and 10.6 years (95% CI,
  9.9--11.4) earlier hypertension onset. In subgroup analyses, this risk was only
  1.6-fold (95% CI, 1.5--1.7) for late-onset hypertension (age $â‰¥$55 years) but 2.8-fold
  (95% CI, 2.6--2.9) for early-onset hypertension (age <55 years). Elevated systolic
  BP PRS also conferred 1.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2--1.4) risk of CVD and 2.3 years (95%
  CI, 1.6--3.1) earlier onset. In FINRISK, systolic and diastolic BP PRSs improved
  clinical risk prediction of hypertension (but not CVD), increasing the C statistics
  by 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3--1.1). We demonstrate that genetic information improves hypertension
  risk prediction. BP PRSs together with traditional risk factors could improve prediction
  of hypertension and particularly early-onset hypertension, which confers substantial
  CVD risk.
