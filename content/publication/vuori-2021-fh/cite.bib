 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of heart failure among diabetic individuals
is high, even under tight glycemic control. The correlates and
mediators of heart failure risk in individuals with diabetes
need more elucidation in large population-based cohorts with
long follow-up times and a wide panel of biologically relevant
biomarkers. METHODS: In a population-based sample of 3834
diabetic and 90,177 non-diabetic individuals, proportional
hazards models and mediation analysis were used to assess the
relation of conventional heart failure risk factors and
biomarkers with incident heart failure. RESULTS: Over a median
follow-up of 13.8 years, a total of 652 (17.0%) and 5524
(6.1%) cases of incident heart failure were observed in
participants with and without diabetes, respectively. 51.4%
were women and the mean age at baseline was 48.7 (standard
deviation [SD] 12.5) years. The multivariable-adjusted hazard
ratio (HR) for heart failure among diabetic individuals was 2.70
(95% confidence interval, 2.49-2.93) compared to non-diabetic
participants. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models,
conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as
smoking (diabetes: HR 2.07 [1.59-2.69]; non-diabetes: HR 1.85
[1.68-2.02]), BMI (diabetes: HR 1.30 [1.18-1.42]; non-diabetes:
HR 1.40 [1.35-1.47]), baseline myocardial infarction (diabetes:
HR 2.06 [1.55-2.75]; non-diabetes: HR 2.86 [2.50-3.28]), and
baseline atrial fibrillation (diabetes: HR 1.51 [0.82-2.80];
non-diabetes: HR 2.97 [2.21-4.00]) had the strongest
associations with incident heart failure. In addition,
biomarkers for cardiac strain (represented by nT-proBNP,
diabetes: HR 1.26 [1.19-1.34]; non-diabetes: HR 1.43
[1.39-1.47]), myocardial injury (hs-TnI, diabetes: HR 1.10
[1.04-1.16]; non-diabetes: HR 1.13 [1.10-1.16]), and
inflammation (hs-CRP, diabetes: HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24];
non-diabetes: HR 1.29 [1.25-1.34]) were also associated with
incident heart failure. In general, all these associations were
equally strong in non-diabetic and diabetic individuals.
However, the strongest mediators of heart failure in diabetes
were the direct effect of diabetes status itself (relative
effect share 43.1% [33.9-52.3] and indirect effects (effect
share 56.9% [47.7-66.1]) mediated by obesity (BMI, 13.2%
[10.3-16.2]), cardiac strain/volume overload (nT-proBNP, 8.4%
[-0.7-17.4]), and hyperglycemia (glucose, 12.0% [4.2-19.9]).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the main mediators of
heart failure in diabetes are obesity, hyperglycemia, and
cardiac strain/volume overload. Conventional cardiovascular risk
factors are strongly related to incident heart failure, but
these associations are not stronger in diabetic than in
non-diabetic individuals. Active measurement of relevant
biomarkers could potentially be used to improve prevention and
prediction of heart failure in high-risk diabetic patients.},
